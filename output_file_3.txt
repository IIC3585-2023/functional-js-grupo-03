    So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí).




    Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro).




    I'm on tonight.

    Baila en la calle de día (let's go).




    Baila en la calle de noche.




    Baila en la calle de día.

    Oh, baby, when you talk like that.




    You know you got me hypnotized.




    So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí).




    Reading the signs of my body.

    The attraction, the tension.
